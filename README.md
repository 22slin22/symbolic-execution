# Symbolic Execution

Symbolic execution is the technique of running programs with symbolic variables instead of concrete inputs.
This lets one reason about entire classes of input and can find specific input values for which the program is not well-behaved.
See [A Survey of Symbolic Execution Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00502.pdf) for more details.
